=========
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |sdsd|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|---:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |1|
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |2|
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |3|

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
